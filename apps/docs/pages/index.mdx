# Nerdfish Ui

Introducing Nerdfishui, a custom component library built with React and
TailwindCSS. Designed to streamline the proof of concept development process and
provide a collection of visually pleasing and functional components, Nerdfishui
is the perfect tool for any developer looking to quickly and efficiently build
beautiful and functional user interfaces.

It's an oppinionated library, so you might not agree with all the design, but
you can add your own styles to the components.

It's mainly [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives with some custom
styling, with strong inspiration from
