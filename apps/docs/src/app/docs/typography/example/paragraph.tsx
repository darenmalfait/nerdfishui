			<Paragraph>
				Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Emily who loved nothing
				more than baking cakes. Her specialty was a rich, decadent chocolate
				cake that was always a hit with her family and friends. One day, Emily
				decided to enter her cake into a local baking competition. She spent
				hours perfecting the recipe and decorating the cake with intricate
				designs made from fondant. When the day of the competition arrived,
				Emily nervously presented her cake to the judges. After what felt like
				an eternity, the judges announced that Emily had won first place!
				Overwhelmed with joy, Emily hugged her cake tightly and knew that all of
				her hard work had paid off.
