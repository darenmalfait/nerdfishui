			<h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
			<p>
				Long ago, in a land far away, there was a magical kingdom ruled by a
				kind and just king. The kingdom was full of riches, and the people were
				happy and content. But one day, a dark sorcerer cast a curse upon the
				land, causing the crops to wither and the rivers to dry up.
			</p>
			<h2>Chapter 2: The Quest</h2>
			<p>
				The king, in his wisdom, knew that the only way to break the curse was
				to find the legendary Golden Apple. The Golden Apple was said to be
				guarded by a fierce dragon in a far-off land, and whoever could retrieve
				it would be granted one wish.
			</p>
			<h3>Chapter 3: The Journey</h3>
			<p>
				The king called forth his bravest knight, Sir Cedric, to undertake the
				quest for the Golden Apple. Sir Cedric set out on his journey, facing
				many dangers and obstacles along the way.
			</p>
			<h5>Chapter 4: The Battle</h5>
			<p>
				Sir Cedric finally reached the dragon's lair, where he was met with a
				fierce battle. But Sir Cedric was brave and skilled, and he was able to
				defeat the dragon and retrieve the Golden Apple.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"With this Golden Apple, I wish for the curse to be lifted and for
				prosperity to return to our kingdom," Sir Cedric said as he returned to
				the king.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The king was overjoyed and bestowed many honors upon Sir Cedric,
				including:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Knight of the Realm</li>
				<li>Duke of the Kingdom</li>
				<li>Protector of the Golden Apple</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The curse was lifted, and the kingdom returned to its former glory. Sir
				Cedric was hailed as a hero and his legend lived on for generations to
				come.
