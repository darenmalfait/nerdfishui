/>

## Install

To install the component-library run the following within your project
directory.

```bash
npm install @nerdfish/react @nerdfish/utils postcss tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
```

## Configuration

```bash
//postcss.config.mjs
export { default } from '@nerdfish/react/postcss.config.mjs'
```

Then you need a global css file which you import at the root of the project

```css
//styles.css
@import '@nerdfish/react/styles/global.css';
@source "../../node_modules/@nerdfish/react"; // path to nerdfishui
```

### Portals

To make portalled components always appear on top of the entire page, add the following div element to your application layout root:

```tsx
<body>
	<div className="isolate">{children}</div>
</body>
```
