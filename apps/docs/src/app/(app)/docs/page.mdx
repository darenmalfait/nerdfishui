Introducing Nerdfishui - a custom component library built with React and
TailwindCSS to help streamline proof of concept development and provide visually
pleasing and functional components. Nerdfishui is the perfect tool for
developers who want to quickly create stunning and user-friendly interfaces.

It's an oppinionated library, so you might not agree with all the design, but
you can add your own styles to the components.
