<H1>The Legend of the Golden Apple</H1>
<H2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</H2>
<Paragraph>
  Long ago, in a land far away, there was a magical kingdom ruled by a kind
  and just king. The kingdom was full of riches, and the people were happy and
  content. But one day, a dark sorcerer cast a curse upon the land, causing
  the crops to wither and the rivers to dry up.
</Paragraph>
<H3>Chapter 2: The Quest</H3>
<Paragraph>
  The king, in his wisdom, knew that the only way to break the curse was to
  find the legendary Golden Apple. The Golden Apple was said to be guarded by
  a fierce dragon in a far-off land, and whoever could retrieve it would be
  granted one wish.
</Paragraph>
<H4>Chapter 3: The Journey</H4>
<Paragraph>
  The king called forth his bravest knight, Sir Cedric, to undertake the quest
  for the Golden Apple. Sir Cedric set out on his journey, facing many dangers
  and obstacles along the way.
</Paragraph>
<H5>Chapter 4: The Battle</H5>
<Paragraph>
  Sir Cedric finally reached the dragon's lair, where he was met with a fierce
  battle. But Sir Cedric was brave and skilled, and he was able to defeat the
  dragon and retrieve the Golden Apple.
</Paragraph>
<blockquote>
  "With this Golden Apple, I wish for the curse to be lifted and for
  prosperity to return to our kingdom," Sir Cedric said as he returned to the
  king.
</blockquote>
<Paragraph>
  The king was overjoyed and bestowed many honors upon Sir Cedric, including:
</Paragraph>
<ul>
  <li>Knight of the Realm</li>
  <li>Duke of the Kingdom</li>
  <li>Protector of the Golden Apple</li>
</ul>
<Paragraph>
  The curse was lifted, and the kingdom returned to its former glory. Sir
  Cedric was hailed as a hero and his legend lived on for generations to come.
