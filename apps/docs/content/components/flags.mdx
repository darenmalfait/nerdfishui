## Features

- Hooks API
- Render Props API
- Nested Flags

Import the `FlagsProvider` in your code and wrap your application around it.

```tsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { FlagsProvider } from '@nerdfish/ui'

import { App } from './components/app'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<FlagsProvider features={{ niceFeature: true }}>
		<App />
	</FlagsProvider>,
)
```

Now use `useFeature`, `Feature` to check if the feature is enabled in your application:

### Features Valid Values

**Using an Array**

```tsx
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<FlagsProvider features={['niceFeature', 'anotherFeature']}>
		<App />
	</FlagsProvider>,
)
```

**Using an Object**

```tsx
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<FlagsProvider features={{ niceFeature: true, anotherFeature: false }}>
		<App />
	</FlagsProvider>,
)
```

**Using Nested Objects**

```tsx
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<FlagsProvider
		features={{
			niceFeature: true,
			content: { anotherFeature: true, admin: false },
		}}
	>
		<App />
	</FlagsProvider>,
)
```

If you use nested objects you will need to either use the `useFeatures` hook or pass a string separated by `/`, e.g. `content/anotherFeature` to read nested flags, if you don't pass the whole path you will get an object so `content` will return `{ anotherFeature: false }` when reading it.

### `useFeature` Custom Hook

The `useFeature` custom hook is the base for the Render Prop implementation, it lets you check if a single feature is enabled and get a boolean, then you can do anything you want with that value, uesful to use it in combination with other hooks like useEffect or to show two different UIs based on a feature being enabled or not.

```tsx
import { useFeature } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	const hasNiceFeature = useFeature('niceFeature')

	return (
		<header>
			{hasNiceFeature ? <h1>My App niceFeature</h1> : <h1>My App v1</h1>}
		</header>
	)
}
```

### `Feature` Render Prop

The `Feature` component works using the render prop pattern and as a wrapper. This component is useful if you want to hide an specific part of a component behind a feature flag but don't want to wrap the whole component.

Pass the name of the feature you want to check for and a children value and it will not render the children if the feature is enabled.

```tsx
import { Feature } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	return (
		<header>
			<Feature name="niceFeature">
				<h1>My App niceFeature</h1>
			</Feature>
		</header>
	)
}
```

Another option is to pass a function as children and get a boolean if the feature is enabled, this way you can render two different pieces of UI based on the feature being enabled or not.

```tsx
import { Feature } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	return (
		<header>
			<Feature name="niceFeature">
				{(isEnabled) =>
					isEnabled ? <h1>My App niceFeature</h1> : <h1>My App v1</h1>
				}
			</Feature>
		</header>
	)
}
```

In both cases you could also send a `render` prop instead of `children`.

```tsx
import { Feature } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	return (
		<header>
			<Feature name="niceFeature" render={<h1>My App niceFeature</h1>} />
		</header>
	)
}
```

```tsx
import { Feature } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	return (
		<header>
			<Feature
				name="niceFeature"
				render={(isEnabled) =>
					isEnabled ? <h1>My App niceFeature</h1> : <h1>My App v1</h1>
				}
			/>
		</header>
	)
}
```

### `useFeatures` Custom Hook

The `useFeatures` custom hook is the base for the `useFeature` custom hook, it gives you the entire feature flags object or array you sent to `FlagsProvider` so you could use it however you want.

```tsx
import { useFeatures } from '@nerdfish/ui'

export function Header() {
	let features = useFeatures()

	return (
		<header>
			{features.niceFeature ? <h1>My App niceFeature</h1> : <h1>My App v1</h1>}
		</header>
	)
}
```
