title: 'Getting started with @nerdfishui'
description:
  'A custom component library built with React and TailwindCSS to help
  streamline proof of concept development and provide visually pleasing and
  functional components.'
---

## Install

To install the component-library run the following within your project
directory.

```bash
npm install @nerdfish/theme @nerdfish/tailwind-config @nerdfish/ui @nerdfish/utils postcss tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography @heroicons/react
```

## Configuration

The theme of this library depends on the @tailwindcss/typography plugin. To use
it, follow the steps on the plugin source page.
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography

```js
//tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  content: [
    // ... paths that use tailwind
    './node_modules/@nerdfish/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // path to nerdfishui
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@nerdfish/tailwind-config'),
  ],
}
```

```js
//postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

Then you need a global css file which you import at the root of the project

```css
//styles.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Usage

```jsx
//AppProviders.js
import {ThemeProvider, H1} from '@nerdfish/ui'
import * as React from 'react'
import '@nerdfish/theme/dist/nerdfishui.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <H1>Hello {`<Â°))>{`}</H1>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```
